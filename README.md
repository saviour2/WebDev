## Version 1.3.1 - Critical Bug Fixes & Stability
**Date:** 2025-09-30

### Issues Fixed
- **Section Visibility Crisis:** Resolved CSS-JavaScript class mismatch causing all sections except hero to be completely invisible
  - **Problem:** CSS expected `.fade-in` class, JavaScript was adding `.animate-fade-in`
  - **Solution:** Updated CSS to recognize both classes + directly added classes to HTML sections
- **Project Filtering System:** Corrected JavaScript selector mismatch
  - **Problem:** JavaScript targeted `.project-tab`, HTML used `.project-filter-btn`
  - **Solution:** Updated JavaScript selector to match HTML implementation
- **Resume Modal Malfunction:** Fixed close button event handler connection
  - **Problem:** JavaScript looked for `#resume-close` ID, HTML used `#close-modal`
  - **Solution:** Updated JavaScript to target correct DOM element
- **Mobile Theme Toggle:** Added missing functionality for mobile devices
  - **Problem:** Mobile theme button had no event listener or icon updates
  - **Solution:** Added event handler and synchronized icon changes with desktop toggle
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Enhanced Safari support
  - **Problem:** `backdrop-filter` not supported in Safari without webkit prefix
  - **Solution:** Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` prefixes for glass effects
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Added proper ARIA labels
  - **Problem:** Interactive buttons lacked discernible text for screen readers
  - **Solution:** Added `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons

### Status After Fixes
- ✅ All sections now visible and properly animated
- ✅ Theme toggle fully functional on both desktop and mobile
- ✅ Project filtering tabs operational with correct data loading
- ✅ Resume modal opens/closes with proper security watermark
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility achieved (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Accessibility standards met (WCAG compliant)
- ✅ Error-free code validation

### Development Notes
